# EasyDraw
A simple tool to draw and use predefined GUI components.

# History
This project was primarily developed privately but now it is continued in terms of a school project of the Hermann-Emanuel-Berufskolleg.


# Known bugs
- none so far but:
  -> text-fields have been functionally removed because the whole "interaction system" was buggy and unclear.
  -> text-fields will be implemented again within the next commits.


# Planed features
- add text-fields (then added again because before the complete "interaction system" was kind of buggy)
- add video components
- add simple background sound tracks.
- add complex buttons: a button which has a complex shape.
- add scalable content: components can be zoomed in/out with different levels of detail (especially for creating maps or games).
