# Known bugs
- The predefined color doesn't show up for the hover action on a button.


# Planed features
- add video components
- add simple background sound tracks.
- add complex buttons: a button which has a complex shape.
- add scalable content: components can be zoomed in/out with different levels of detail (especially for creating maps or games).
