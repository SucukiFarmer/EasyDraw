# EasyDraw
A simple tool to draw and use predefined GUI components. Provides abilities to enable additional multimedia support, e.g. adding videos or scalable content (planed in future).

# History
This project was primarily developed privately but now it is continued in terms of a school project of the Hermann-Emanuel-Berufskolleg.


# Known bugs
- The predefined color doesn't show up for the hover action on a button.


# Planed features
- add video components
- add simple sound tracks
- add complex button: a button which has a complex shape.
- add scalable content: components can be zoomed in/out with different levels of detail (especially for creating maps or games).
