# EasyDraw
A simple tool to draw and use predefined GUI components.

# History
This project was primarily developed privately but now it is continued in terms of a school project of the Hermann-Emanuel-Berufskolleg.


# Component Features
- Texts
- Buttons
- Text-fields
- Images/pictures
- Paths
- Rectangles


# Runtime Features
- Components tasks can be executed using threads (real-time mode)
- Draw context can be run in "Gaming Mode"
- "Gaming Mode" is a new feature which just infinitely executes the repaint-method as fast as possible.
- The other way around (turned off) the draw context is only redrawn on specific events to reduce CPU usage.


# Planed features
- add video components
- add simple background sound tracks.
- add complex buttons: a button which has a complex shape.
- add scalable content: components can be zoomed in/out with different levels of detail (especially for creating maps or games).
- add hyperlinks to open links on the web.
