**A simple API to make 2D game development easier and GUI creation more controllable with Java ‚òïÔ∏è**


If you want to test this API first, you can just download the binaries ("bin"-folder) and run the Main.class file.
It will give you a look through all the features which are available currently.
Don't get too frustrated by the old graphics as you can actually overwrite the whole design easily.
Currently, the focus of the development goes on solidity and stability before anything else.


# First Impression
![Application sample](https://i.ibb.co/qdhZN4J/preview.png)


# Uses of GUInness
- for development of simple 2D games
- for fast creation of GUI environments
- for highly modifiable GUIs
- as a lightweight alternative to the Swing library


# Features
- GUI components organized in "layers" with priorities**¬π**
- all GUI components are very easy-to-use in your code
- dozens of very detailed error logs and brief comments
- simple way to create your own design / look**¬≤**
- capable of multi-threading
- Viewport movement & scaling**¬≥**

**¬π**comparable to HTML (to get a very rough impression on how it works)

**¬≤**by using the "Classic.java" as a base for further implementations

**¬≥**especially for creating maps, games or browser-related content


# Component Features
- Texts
- Buttons (rectangle button / default)
- Polygon buttons (a special and dynamic shape button)
- Textfields
- Checkboxes
- Selection-boxes (with radio buttons)
- Images/pictures
- Rectangles


# Runtime Features
- Components tasks / actions can be executed by enabling "multi-threading" per object method.


# Stability And Solidity First
As already mentioned, the main goal is it to keep and improve the stability.
For the solidity it is the case that the code is tried to be kept as small and clean as possible.
It is also important for me not to get messy with the code structure and to deliver enough comments and error messages for best maintenance.
If these points are also really guaranteed the next step would it be theoretically to add a new feature.


# Planed Features
- add paths
- add video components
- add simple background sound tracks
- add ability for LOD levels depending on the current Viewport scale**¬π**
- add hyperlinks to open links on the web

**¬π**especially for creating maps, games or browser-related content


# Documentation
Will follow at the final release because several things / features can still change "fundamentally".
This means, it isn't the effort worth until now to note every single change.
Anyway, there are of course dozens of comments and a sample application (Main.java) for better understanding.
It really shouldn't lack of brief comments in the code actually..üëç


# History
GUInness was originally written first because I wanted to build a solid structure in order
to build 2D games more easily.
At all I want to build a simple strategy game which probably lacks of graphics but is rich in terms of features.
I could have used available game engines from the web but my plan was it to build everything up from scratch,
so that's the challenge for me.


# Stats / Nice To Know (as of Sep 12 2020)
- Total lines of code: 3244 (counted them with "[cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)")
- Code size: ~125.2¬†kB

# Donations (via LiteCoin)
I do this in my free-time so any donation would be highly appreciated;
especially in the mind of open-source it is more about the attention someone gives me rather than the amount.
